# My Guitar Store :)
Welcome to my Guitar Store!

It is an application created using React (Pattern Fly 4) &amp; Ruby On Rails
Hope you like it :)

*Prerequisites*

Please ensure you have installed:

- Ruby version 2.7.x

*Running The App*

Before running the server you should install by running the following commands:
```
bundle install
yarn install
```

To run the application's server run:
```
rails server
```
When the server is up and running, navigate to: "http://127.0.0.1:3000/" on any browser to start using the app :)

*Epilogue*

Feel free to open a new PR in case you have any suggestions for any improvements to the app :)

Be sure to udpate me in case I should have done something differently or more efficiently 

This project was built using `rails new --webpacker=react` and then added PatternFly.
